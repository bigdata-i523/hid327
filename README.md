   title: Fraud, Waste, and Abuse in United States Healthcare
   abstract: The cost of healthcare includes the cost of inefficient services.  While 
this could include topics such as misdiagnosis, less effective treatment plans, 
and more efficient use of types of services (emergency room vs. immediate care 
vs. telemedicine) the purpose of this paper is the cost of Fraud, Waste, and 
Abuse (FWA) within the system.  The question is "How can we use big data analysis to 
help minimize the loss due to FWA and thus optimize the money spent on healthcare.
