   title: Using Big Data to minimize Fraud, Waste, and Abuse (FWA) in United States Healthcare
   abstract: >
       The cost of healthcare includes the loss of billions of dollars due to Fraud, 
       Waste, and Abuse (FWA).  Many of the schemes to commit FWA are very intricate and 
       require the analysis of many data sources simultaneously.  The question answered 
       here is ``How can we use big data analysis to help minimize these costs and thus 
       optimize the money spent on healthcare.''

   title: The Impact of Self-Driving Cars on the Economy
   abstract: >
       Self-driving cars have the ability to elminate many jobs related to driving.  
       From taxi cabs over the road truck hauling many jobs require a person to drive 
       the vehicle.  The ability to automate this job with self-driving cars could be 
       very detrimental to the US labor market.  This paper is the beginning of a look 
       at how large of an impact that could be.
