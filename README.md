   title: Waste in Healthcare
   abstract: >
       The cost of healthcare includes the cost of inefficient services. While
       this could include topics such as misdiagnosis, less effective treatment
       plans, and more efficient use of types of services (emergency
       room vs. immediate care vs. telemedicine) the purpose of this paper
       is the cost of Fraud, Waste, and Abuse (FWA) within the system.
       The estimate for what percentage of cost are attributable to FWA
       can range from 10-15%.
