        The cost of healthcare includes the loss of billions of
        dollars due to Fraud, Waste, and Abuse (FWA).  Many of the
        schemes to commit FWA are very intricate and require the
        analysis of many data sources simultaneously.  The question
        answered here is, how can we use big data analysis to help
        minimize these costs and thus optimize the money spent on
        healthcare?

        Self-driving cars have the ability to elminate many jobs
        related to driving. From taxi cabs over the road truck hauling
        many jobs require a person to drive the vehicle.  The ability
        to automate this job with self-driving cars could be very
        detrimental to the US labor market.  This paper is the
        beginning of a look at how large of an impact that could be.

        Aside from people changing their habits, big data analytics 
        may hold the best possibility for the improvement of 
        worldwide health.  It will enable the ability to correctly 
        diagnose patients more quickly, even when the patients may 
        not be able to be physically seen by a provider.  It will 
        be used to create treatment plans specific to not only an 
        illness, but to the patient's overall health condition and 
        history, demographics, environment, and access to resources.  
        While it may not solve the problem of everyone not having 
        access to the best of care, it can help to make sure everyone 
        can get the best care possible for them.  This paper explores 
        the ways in which big data is evolving in the field of 
        healthcare to make these possibilities become realities and 
        looks at some of the social concerns which could hold it back.
