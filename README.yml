    abstract: 'The cost of healthcare includes the loss of billions of dollars due
        to Fraud,  Waste, and Abuse (FWA).  Many of the schemes to commit FWA are
        very intricate and  require the analysis of many data sources simultaneously.  The
        question answered  here is ``How can we use big data analysis to help minimize
        these costs and thus  optimize the money spent on healthcare.''''

    abstract: 'Self-driving cars have the ability to elminate many jobs related to
        driving.   From taxi cabs over the road truck hauling many jobs require a
        person to drive  the vehicle.  The ability to automate this job with self-driving
        cars could be  very detrimental to the US labor market.  This paper is the
        beginning of a look  at how large of an impact that could be.
